Luke Hendley's Portfolio Documents

This is the Document Host page and the Host for my Portfolio Documents. Constructive criticism is welcome, I might not like it much at first but I promise that I will look at it and  consider it. As an added note, this is my first portfolio for an entry level position in Technical Writing. Do not expect anything great from this work. Do not look to this work as the premierre example of what to do in technical writing. Possibly use this as inspiration that you can do so much of a better job than this in your own writing.
