								<p>This is my portfolio website, meant to both demonstrate my ability to write docs as code and also share the work that I have done in the past. So if you are looking to see if I am someone worth hiring or are interested in what a website portfolio can look like, you are in the right place.</p>
								<p>As a quick guide to how this site works, here are the essentials of what is in each section:</p>
								<li><b>Work</b> - This section includes summaries of the projects I would like to showcase and links to view the projects in question.</li>
								<li><b>About</b> - This section contains a brief background on myself; most of the information will be the same as what is detailed on my resume, should you possess it.</li>
								<li><b>Contact</b> - This is my phone, e-mail, LinkedIn, and GitHub. Any of these will work to contact me, but phone and e-mail will get the fastest response.</li>
								<p></p>
								<p>I hope you enjoy what I have put together here, as it has been surprisingly fun to create this website. I look forward to doing more writing–and more documentation–in the future.</p>

								<p>This section contains short summaries of all the Portfolio Documents as well as links to the documents themselves, when possible. I have completed document work considered FOUO, so it can not be shared. However, a summary of the project and the process for its completion will still be included.</p>
								<h3>Project 1 - Mozilla Article</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Firefox.jfif" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>Contributed</strong>: August 2020</p>
								<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Rewrote the webpage printing for the Mac segment of the page to fix inaccuracies.</p>
								<p><strong>Process:</strong> Using the previous Mac Printing article as a template, I removed the old information and added new information by opening Firefox on my personal Mac computer and moving through the printing process. Once the draft work was complete, I used editing programs to check the work for errors, then sent it in for review.</p>
								<p><strong>Result:</strong> Mac Printing changes were accepted; however, the changes made may no longer be available because of further changes to the program.</p>

								<h3>Project 2 - PB&J SOP</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/PB&J.jfif" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>Contributed:</strong> October 2022</p>
								<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> This was practice creating an SOP using a commonly created lunch item as the SOPs subject.</p>
								<p><strong>Process:</strong> Firstly, as this was the first construction of this kind of document, a day was used to research the specifics of what is required for a proper SOP. This was a combination of looking up written and video guides and checking government sites that require their SOPs to be published. After examining these resources and sites, a general template was put together. Following that, the description and overall writing style were chosen. With all of this set, the SOP itself was finally constructed. Once the draft was complete, the writing was reviewed and put through editing programs to confirm the grammatical accuracy of the document's contents.</p>
								<p><strong>Result:</strong> The SOP is a detailed description of how to assemble a PB&J sandwich, including specific techniques for creation that may benefit an individual with little experience in sandwich making.</p>

								<h3>Project 3 - State Profiles</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/FEMALogo.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>Contributed:</strong> March 2022</p>
								<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> FEMA Region 7 State Profiles to aid in Disaster Response and Recovery.</p>
								<p><strong>Process:</strong> This previously unfinished project needed to be updated, completed, and standardized. It started with the collection of old resources used by the project, including the templates put together by the previous team. After putting these together, investigating the resources, and consulting the client, we picked one template as a base and began filing in information. Because this project relied on information not necessarily discoverable in public domain, we coordinated with other individuals within the organization to obtain information to fill in the documentation. Our contract ended with us having filled in the majority of the information and completing some edits suggested by the contractor to improve the work. Weekly meetings with said contractor were held to provide updates, put in RFIs, and clarify questions.</p>
								<p><strong>Result:</strong> My and my team's work on this project received verbal praise multiple times from the contractor and other members of the contractor's team. The document serves as an aid to any new individuals coming into the region so that they can quickly familiarize themselves with the necessary information.</p>
								<p>As this project is FOUO, I am unable to link the project work at this time.</p>
				
								<h3>Project 4 - Control Panel</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/DroidStarfighter.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>Contributed:</strong> July 2022</p>
								<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> This is a fictional Control Script guide for piloting droid ships from the Star Wars universe.</p>
								<p><strong>Process:</strong> This was not created by researching other control scripts but by analyzing REST API documentation. After looking through multiple REST API documents, the concept of the program itself, as well as how to document it, was created. After putting together a general template based loosely on the API documentation and deciding on a style guide, the project was put together. As this was documentation for a fictional project, there were equal amounts of editing the project itself as there was editing the documentation.</p>
								<p><strong>Result:</strong> The result is a guide to a fictional tool, allowing individuals to use the guide to make the "tool" as a game similar to Zork, should they wish to.</p>

								<h3>Project 5 - MadCap Flare Practice</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Disney.jfif" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>Contributed:</strong> November 2022</p>
								<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> Disney + user guide meant to make using and navigating the Disney + webpage easier.</p>
								<p><strong>Process:</strong> After researching various user guides, a PDF template was selected from those available in the MadCap Flare documentation tool. After filling out the template to match a user guide, an already present Disney + account and various Disney + videos were used to fill in the crucial details for each category. After the initial draft was completed, editing programs were used to aid in the editing process of the documentation. Afterward, as the trial version of MadCap Flare scrambles finished documents, the pdf was inserted into a PDF editor. After completion, the PDF was put through another image editing program to finalize changes to the document.</p>
								<p><strong>Result:</strong> A mostly polished Disney + user guide. The mouse got caught in the screenshot on some of the PDF pictures used in the project. Besides that, it will aid new users of Disney + in navigating some of the trickier parts of the webpage.</p>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/LukePhoto.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm Luke G. Hendley, a communications professional specializing in Interpersonal and Written Communications. What all of that translates to is that I'm a professional communicator with a knack for small group communications and for communicating complex concepts in a way someone will understand using writing.</p>
								<p>I graduated from North Carolina State University with a BA in Interpersonal Communications. After some volunteer technical writing and editing, I worked as a FEMA Corps Member. I was essentially an intern for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
								<p>While working in FEMA Corps, I spent near half a year working on State and Tribal profiles, documents recording everything an emergency management worker would need to know about a state or tribe so that they can quickly start a disaster response mission and help them.</p>
								<p>Since graduating from the FEMA Corps program, I've been putting together technical writing projects to help further demonstrate my ability as a technical writer. These projects are much of what makes up the works presented on this site.</p>
